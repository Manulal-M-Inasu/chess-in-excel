# chess-in-excel
A chess engine programmed in VBA with EXCEL us GUI
Fully functional chess engine in MS Excel. No tables or opening books used. Each move is based on an alpha beta pruning search which makes the engine a bit slow. 
This was my hobby project and hence speed or efficiency was not of much importance.
My objective was to succeed in a seemingly difficult task (at least to someone who has no training in programming) of making an excel sheet play chess against you.
